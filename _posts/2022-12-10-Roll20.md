Here are some fun Roll20 things.

## Links/Images/GIFs in Chat

The syntax for posting a link in chat is like this:

```
[click here](https://www.google.com/)
```

But if you link to an image, then it puts the image in chat by default.  That includes GIFs.  Click the button below to copy this one and then paste it in chat:
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```

```

## Macros for Visual Effects on Character Tokens

### Single Target
Here's the code for a visual effect based on one token, like a stink effect.  It asks you which effect you want and what color.
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
/fx ?{Effect|bomb|bubbling|burn|burst|explode|glow|missile|nova|splatter}-?{Color|acid|blood|charm|death|fire|frost|holy|magic|slime|smoke|water} @{target|Where?|token_id}
// Doesn't include beam or breath.  These are the visual effects based around a single token.
```
### Multi-Target
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
/fx ?{Directed Effect|beam|breath}-?{Color|acid|blood|charm|death|fire|frost|holy|magic|slime|smoke|water} @{target|Source|token_id} @{target|Target|token_id}
```
You can copy/paste these into chat, but you can also save them as a Macro (under the ⁝☰ part of the Roll20 menu).  That lets you add the code as a button.
