This will walk you through making a hard-coded macro for your attack, so you don't have to answer fx queries to create an effect.  If you want info about the basics of links/fx, see [this blog post.](https://jkeneda.github.io/dnd/2022/12/10/Roll20.html)

## Designing Your Macro

<select name="cars" id="cars">
    <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
    <option value="saab">Saab</option>
    <option value="opel">Opel</option>
    <option value="audi">Audi</option>
  </select>

## Macros for Visual Effects on Character Tokens

### Single Target
Here's the code for a visual effect based on one token, like a stink effect.  It asks you which effect you want and what color.
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
/fx ?{Effect|bomb|bubbling|burn|burst|explode|glow|missile|nova|splatter}-?{Color|acid|blood|charm|death|fire|frost|holy|magic|slime|smoke|water} @{target|Where?|token_id}
// Doesn't include beam or breath.  These are the visual effects based around a single token.
```
### Multi-Target
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
/fx ?{Directed Effect|beam|breath}-?{Color|acid|blood|charm|death|fire|frost|holy|magic|slime|smoke|water} @{target|Source|token_id} @{target|Target|token_id}
```
You can copy/paste these into chat, but you can also save them as a Macro (under the ⁝☰ part of the Roll20 menu).  That lets you add the code as a button.
